# Event simulation configuration

      distribution:
        type: exponential
        scale: 5  # Average 5 days between entity arrivals
    max_entities: n/a  # n/a means the simulation will keep generating entities following the distribution
  
  # Event sequence configuration
  # This defines the flow of events and their specific durations and resource requirements

    # Define all event types with their specific durations and resource requirements
    # Each event type MUST have both duration and resource_requirements defined
